            	<div class="head">Specializing in Acting and Print Work Photography </div>
                <div class="space"></div>
                <p> Originally from New Zealand, I've worked as a Photographer for more than 10 years. I started in a friends darkroom with my older brother who was desperate to show me how good of a photographer he was. 
				Maybe it was sibling rivalry, I'm not sure, but I set out to show him that I was good as well. In High School Photography Class is where I realized quickly that Photography made sense to me, seemingly more 
				than my friends struggling in the dark. 
				<br />
				When I turned 21 I moved to Los Angeles,CA, where I got a job with an English News Service as a staff Photographer and then transferred to New York City and visited 
				many places in between covering news and human interest stories. After I was married I  worked on the New York Post, and worked as an in-house Photographer for the New York Daily News. My work has appeared 
				in international newspapers and publications with photographs of many of the worlds rich and most famous. 
				<br />
				Now that I've settled down with a beautiful family, my husband Alex and I, who is an Acting Coach 
				and is associated with Paladino casting, we are offering our skills and services to aspiring celebrities in the New York and New Jersey areas in a friendly environment at a price you can afford. We offer 
				studio and location photo sessions, in both New York City and New Jersey and we are always open to your ideas if you have a special location in mind. We offer headshots, model cards, actors cards, all for 
				children through to adults. 
				<br />
				So consider us if its your first time having your picture taken or when your photographs need updating. You'll enjoy our relaxed atmosphere, sense of humour and our ability to 
				capture the true essence of you. Many of my clients have told me that their headshot brought them "luck". One family even gave us a Baby Grand Piano, when her 11 year old daughter landed a permanant role on a 
				Soap Opera! I'm not asking for gifts, but I get great pleasure from turning on the TV and seeing faces that I recognize, with a little "luck" and lot of hard work and some great photographs that could be you!
